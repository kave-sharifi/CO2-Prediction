# CO₂ Emissions Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict CO₂ emissions from vehicles based on their characteristics using machine learning techniques. The study is motivated by the increasing global concern over climate change and the need to understand and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation sector.

## Dataset
The dataset includes detailed vehicle attributes such as:
- Make
- Model
- Vehicle Class
- Engine Size
- Cylinders
- Transmission
- Fuel Type
- Fuel Consumption Metrics

**Target Variable:** CO₂ Emissions

**Data Collection Date:** January 19, 2025

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understanding feature distributions
   - Analyzing correlations between features and target
3. **Model Development:**
   - Implementing multiple machine learning models
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R²
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Comparing model accuracy
   - Identifying the best model for CO₂ prediction

## Results
- Key insights from data analysis
- Best performing model and its evaluation metrics
